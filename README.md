# Algorithms & Data Structure implementations in Ruby.

Fascinated and curious about Ruby's expressiveness, this repository contains
my implementations of fundamental CS concepts along with miscellaneous 
HackerRank solutions.

## Inline evaluation

You might stumble across inline comments containing the evaluation of the
statement on that line, e.g.

```ruby
ary = [1, 2, 3, 4]
ary # => [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

This is accomplished with the amazing
[vim-ruby-xmpfilter](https://github.com/t9md/vim-ruby-xmpfilter). More
